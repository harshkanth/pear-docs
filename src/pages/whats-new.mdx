Welcome to the **Pear Documentation Demo-Site**. 

Live Documentation is deployed at: https://becdeg.com/

This page is usually used to provide information on new releases, updates, and fixes but I am using this place to inform you about the docs I have updated and provide structure and its justification.
I have updated the following documents to explain the documents in a better way and have performed some major improvements. I have mentioned (Updated) for the documents which are edited.

### Documents edited
The following documents are edited:
- Understanding Pear
- Getting Started with Pear
- Pear Runtime
- Step-by-Step Guide: Start a Desktop Project
- How-to Connect Two Pears

## Justification for the Documentation Structure

The documentation has been reorganized to present information in a clear and task-focused hierarchy. 
The earlier content was fragmented and difficult to navigate, which increased the effort required for new developers to understand the system. 
The revised structure separates topics into logical categories that follow a natural learning progression. 
Introductory material appears first so that users can acquire fundamental understanding before moving on to detailed information about the Pear Runtime, including the command-line interface, the application programming interface, configuration, and troubleshooting. 
This organization allows developers to locate runtime information without searching through unrelated content.

Practical learning is supported by a dedicated Step-by-Step Guide, which allows users to build and test projects in a controlled sequence.
Technical reference material, including storage, networking, encryption, and core modules, is grouped together so that developers can quickly consult the specific components they are working with. 
Workflow instructions are placed in a separate How-To section, and tools are documented independently to make focused tasks easier to locate. Real-world use cases demonstrate how Pear operates in different environments, which supports learning through practical examples and encourages best practices.

This structure improves readability, reduces cognitive load, and supports long-term maintenance. 
Each section now has a defined purpose and follows conventions commonly used in professional developer documentation. 
The result is a user-centered information architecture that enhances discoverability and strengthens the overall learning experience.
