# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the FAQ section. These are the most common questions developers ask when getting started with Pear.

---

## ❓ What exactly is Pear?

Pear is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) runtime and development tool built for local-first applications.  
It removes the need for servers, cloud hosting, or centralized infrastructure.  
Apps connect directly to each other, discover peers, and replicate data securely.

---

## ❓ Is Pear open source?

Yes. Pear and all its components are open-source and available on GitHub.  
You can fork, modify, and contribute.

---

## ❓ Do I need a server or cloud backend?

No. Pear apps use **direct encrypted P2P connections**.  
Data lives with users, not on a central server.

---

## ❓ Which platforms does Pear support?

Pear runs on:

- Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Terminal / CLI
- Mobile (iOS & Android)

---

## ❓ What language or framework does Pear use?

Pear supports JavaScript and TypeScript.  
Use your existing web dev skills — no special language required.

---

## ❓ Can Pear apps go offline?

Yes. Pear apps are **local-first**.  
They work offline and automatically sync when peers come back online.

---

## ❓ What type of apps can I build?

Popular use cases:

- Collaboration apps (notes, docs, chats, whiteboards)
- Real-time sharing tools
- Offline-first productivity apps
- Distributed storage apps
- Anything that benefits from no servers

---

## ❓ How do peers discover each other?

Pear uses cryptographic identities and DHT-based peer discovery.  
You never expose user IPs, and all connections are encrypted end-to-end.

---

## ❓ Is Pear production-ready?

Pear is evolving rapidly. The runtime is stable, and the ecosystem is expanding.
